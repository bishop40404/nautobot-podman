# System pre-requisites

# Make sure podman is installed
sudo yum install container-tools
podman version

# allow rootless container to open ports
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=443
# (optional) after running containers, set it back to default (1025)
# sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=1025

# Add firewall allow for services
# see before state
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
# add rules
# sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent      -> only need to expose https
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent
# commit changes
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
# see after state
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all



### Log into or swap to the Nautobot account ###
# The rest of this guide will run rootless - as a standard user
# All files and whatnot go under the user's home directory
# The rest of these commands run as a standard user
# Having a proper shell open as your Nautobot user is helpful for environment variables

# Create and enter nautobot directory
mkdir $HOME/nautobot
cd $HOME/nautobot

# Create other directories
mkdir config
mkdir secrets
mkdir postgres_data


# generate cert -> pick your fav encryption algorithm
openssl genrsa -aes-256-cbc -out nautobot.key 2048
# generate CSR
openssl req -key nautobot.key -new -out nautobot.csr
# TESTING! generate self-signed cert
# Production: take that csr and get a real cert


### Place local.env, nautobot_config.py, nginx_nautobot.conf, and uwsgi.ini into "config" directory ###
### Place creds.env, and nautobot cert files (nautobot.key and nautobot.crt) into "secrets" directory ###





## Permissions ##
# podman will change some permissions on directories for volumes.
# If something messes up and you need to reset, do this:

# stop all containers
podman stop --all

# reset user/group ownership
sudo chown -R [[user]]:[[group]] $HOME/nautobot

# If it's bad enough, you can fully reset podman and delete the postgres database:
podman system reset
rm -rf $HOME/nautobot/postgres_data/*   -> might need sudo due to permissions change by podman
